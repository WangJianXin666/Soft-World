In this book I aim to help professional J2EE developers and architects make the appropriate choices to deliver high-quality solutions on time and within budget. 
 -在书的第一章，约翰生就开章名义的说明这本书旨在于帮助专业的J2EE开发者和架构师选择正确的决定，去及时和有效的传递高质量的方案。
 
 In this chapter, we discuss the high-level choices in developing a J2EE architecture,
 and how to decidewhich parts of J2EE to use to solve real problems.
 We'll look at:
 ❑Distributed and non-distributed applications, and how to choose which model is appropriate
 ❑The implications for J2EE design of changes in the EJB 2.0 specification and the emergence of web services
 ❑When to use EJB⑴
 ❑Data access strategies for J2EE applications
 ❑Four J2EE architectures, and how to choose between them
 ❑Web tier design❑Portability issues
 
 - 具体解决的真实的问题有
 1.分布式和非分布式的应用以及如何选择哪一个模式更合适
 2.
 3.何时使用EJB
 
 
 
 ⑴ (EJB; formerly Enterprise JavaBeans)，is one of several Java APIs for modular construction of enterprise software. 
 EJB is a server-side software component that encapsulates business logic of an application. 
 The EJB specification was originally developed in 1997 by IBM and later adopted by Sun Microsystems (EJB 1.0 and 1.1) in 1999[2] 
 and enhanced under the Java Community Process as JSR 19 (EJB 2.0), JSR 153 (EJB 2.1), JSR 220 (EJB 3.0), JSR 318 (EJB 3.1) and JSR 345 (EJB 3.2).
